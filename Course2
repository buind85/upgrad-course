Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems

Ngoc Dung
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
This algorihtm is implemented by dividing a problem into smaller sub-problems. Then solve each subproblem indepdently.
Next step is to combine the solutions to subproblems to get solution to original problem.
Repeat until the subproblem simple enough to solve directly.
